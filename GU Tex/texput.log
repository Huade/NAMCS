Chapter 1.

*The US spend 17.9\% of GDP on health expenditure in 2013, according to the Wor
ld Bank, and it is continuing to growth. Some scholars proposed that one way to
 reduce health care spending and improve health care efficiency is to adopt the
 Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR). The Obama Administration has prioritized t
he improvement of quality and efficiency of the health care system. President O
bama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 which provides f
inancial incentive for adoption and meaningful use of electronic health records
. The adoption of EHR increased rapidly [CITATION NEEDED].

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Given the increasing adoption of EHR, and the implementation of EHR incentive 
programs, the effect of electronic health care record on health outcomes are of
 interest. Empirically measured effect of adopting EHR on cost is still very li
mited, and the results are mixed.

*\section{Background}

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*In 2009, the US Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (AR
RA), which appropriates funds to promote the adoption and use of health informa
tion technology (HIT). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has set aside
 \$2 billion which will go towards programs developed by the National Coordinat
or and Secretary to help health care providers implement HIT and provide techni
cal assistance through various regional centers \citep{hhs_recovery}.

(Please type a command or say `\end')
*The Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services launched the Medicare and Medica
id Electronic Health Care Record (EHR) Incentive Programs after the passage of 
ARRA of 2009. These programs provide incentive payments to eligible professiona
ls, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) as they adopt, imp
lement, upgrade or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. In o
rder to receive the EHR stimulus money, the HITECH act (ARRA) requires eligible
 physicians to show "meaningful use" of an EHR system.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Take Medicare EHR incentive program as an example. Eligible physicians must at
test yearly to demonstrating meaningful use to receive the EHR incentive and av
oid a Medicare payment adjustment. In order to demonstrate meaningful use of 20
14 Stage 1, eligible professionals must meet 13 required core objectives and fi
ve menu objectives from a list of 9. The core objectives includes recording sel
ected patient demographics, maintaining active medication list, protecting elec
tronic health information, etc.. The menu objectives includes using certified E
HR technology to identify patient-specific education resources, sending patient
 reminders, and implementing drug formulary checks, etc. \citep{stage1}.

*\section{Effect of EHR on health expenditure}

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Limited empirical studies estimated the potential net benefits that could aris
e from adopting health information technologies (HITs), including the EHR at th
e national level. The RAND Corporation estimated annual net savings to the heal
th care sector from efficiency alone could be \$77 billion or more based survey
s, publications, interviews, and an expert panel review. \citep{Rand2005}. Hill
estad et, al. claimed that effective EHR implementation and networking could ev
entually save more than \$81 billion annually by improving health care efficien
cy and safety. Savings could be doubled by using health information technology 
to preventive care and chronic disease management \citep{Hillestad2005}. Howeve
r, some other researchers do not find the positive cost-saving effect of EHR ad
option on national health expenditure. For example, Adler-Milstein et al. found
 that ambulatory EHR adoption did not impact total cost, although it slowed amb
ulatory cost growth \citep{Adler-Milstein2013}. Sidorov claimed that much of th
e literature on EHRs fails to support the primary rationales for using them, an
d it is unlikely that the U.S. health care bill will decline as a result of the
 EHR alone \citep{Sidorov2006}. There are also researchers suggest the adoption
 of EHR has a negative effect on cost-reduction  \citep{Teufel2012}.

*EHR also provides a platform for predictive analysis, saving health care spend
ing by allocating medical resources efficiently. Bates et al. proposed there ar
e unprecedented opportunities to use big data, acquired from EHR, to reduce the
 costs of health care in the United States \citep{Bates2014}. Roski et al. also
 pointed out big data has the potential to create significant value in health c
are by improving outcomes while lower cost \citep{Roski2014}. However, the inte
gration of EHR into predictive analytics is still challenging. Roski et al. als
o claimed that big data's success in creating value in the health care sector m
ay require changes in current policies to balance the potential societal benefi
ts of big-data approaches and the protection of patients' confidentiality \cite
p{Roski2014}.

*\section{Effect of EHR on healthcare efficiency and quality}

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*The effect of EHR on efficiency is mixed. A systematical literature review sug
gested that 92 percent of the recent articles on health information technology 
show measurable benefits emerging from the adoption of health information techn
ology \citep{Buntin2011}. For example, a study found that hospital with more-ad
vanced health IT had fewer complications, lower mortality, and lower costs than
 their counterparts\citep{amarasingham2009clinical}. Other suggest that simply 
adopting electronic health records is likely to be insufficient to drive substa
ntial gains in quality or efficiency \citep{DesRoches2010}.

*Time efficiency is one of the possible outcomes of EHR adoption. Physicians sp
ent time on patients-interactions and documentation of clinical information. Cl
inicians hope that an EHR could increase the patient interaction time, which im
proves the quality of health care, while reducing documentation time \citep{leu
ng2003incentives}. However, EHR is unlikely to reduce documentation time \citep
{poissant2005impact} and the effect of EHR system adoption on time efficiency i
s mixed and varying among different institutions \citep{Chaudhry2006}.

*Another important factor of healthcare efficiency and quality is the likelihoo
d of follow-up health care appointments. Low "kept appointment" rates adversely
 affected continuity of care and led to inefficient clinic scheduling processes
 \citep{myers2001strategies}. Although the CMS listed ``Send reminders to patie
nts per patient preference for preventive/follow-up care'' as an objective in m
easuring meaningful use of EHR system \citep{cmsincentive14}, the evaluation of
 the effect of EHR on patient follow-up rate is limited.

*Patient-centered education, which provided by EHR-based system, allows patient
s to understand their health better and make informed lifestyle adjustments. CM
S requires eligible physicians to provide patient-specific education resources

*On the micro level, EHR has a mixed effect on cost-saving of physician practic
es.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Some scholars claimed that the long-term return on adoption of EHR is positive
. For example, Wang et al. estimated that a provider could gain \$86,400 net be
nefits from using an electronic medical record for a 5-year period, resulting i
n a positive financial return on investment to the health care organization \ci
tep{Wang2003}. Bell and Thornton claimed that based on the size of a health sys
tem and the scope of implementation, benefits of HITs for large hospitals can r
ange from \$37M to \$59M over a five-year period in addition to incentive payme
nts \citep{Bell2011}.

*However, more researchers argued that physicians have insufficient financial i
ncentive to implement EHR in the first place. Gans et al. surveyed a nationally
 representative sample of medical group practices and suggested that adoption o
f EHR is progressing slowly, at least in smaller practices \citep{Gans2005}. Jh
a et al. found a similar result that on the basis of responses from 63.1\% of h
ospitals surveyed, only 1.5\% of U.S. hospitals have a comprehensive electronic
-records system \citep{Jha2009}. Adler-Milstein et al. found electronic health 
records will yield revenue gains for some practices and losses for many by usin
g survey data from 49 community practices. Practices are encountering greater-t
han-expected barriers to adopting an EHR system \citep{Adler-Milstein2012}.

*Giving the increasing participation in the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic He
alth Records (EHR) Incentive Programs, and the increased policy interest in con
trolling health expenditures, the evaluation of the effect of EHR on physician 
behavior are of interest.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Although the number of health information technology evaluation studies is rap
idly increasing, empirically measured behavior data are limited and inconclusiv
e. Some research projected the potential benefit of adoption of EHR with data f
rom surveys, publications, interviews, and expert panel reviews. However, there
 are limited research focus on empirical analysis of national wide data. Litera
ture on outcome of adopting EHR, especially the effect of EHR on patient-specif
ic health education prescription, is limited. This paper could contribute to th
e literature with a national-level perspective and evaluate the outcome of EHR 
adoption on health education, time spent with MD, and returned appointment rate
.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Another major limitation of the literature is its generalization. Insufficient
 reporting of contextual and implementation factors makes it impossible to dete
rmine why most health IT implementations are successful but some are not. This 
paper will consider which factors may contribute to a better outcome of EHR ado
ption. It could help making government incentive programs more efficient by sel
ecting proper physician practices.

*The data source for this study was National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NA
MCS) public use micro-data files. NAMCS is a national probability sample survey
 of visits to office-based physicians conducted by the National Center for Heal
th Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NAMCS has informatio
n at visit level, including whether the physician practice has Electronic Medic
al Record (EMR) system, health education prescription, the breakdown of patient
s by different payment type, time spent with physician for each visit, and whet
her the visit is a returned appointment, etc. The sample size for 2008, 2009, a
nd 2010 public use micro-data files, which includes information about adopting 
EMR, are 28,741, 32,281, and 31,229, respectively.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*I used information on adoption of EMR system to identify the treatment groups 
and potential comparison groups. The survey question was described as "Does you
r practice use an electronic medical record or health record (EMR/HER) system? 
(Not including billing records system)." \citep{NAMCSDOC2010}. Three possible g
roups in this treatment variable including "Yes, all electronic", "Yes, part pa
per and part electronic", and "No". The other characteristics were used as cova

*The sampling of NAMCS is a multistage process. The first-stage sample includes
 112 primary sampling units (PSUs) by geological distribution. The second stage
 stratified physicians into 15 groups and select physicians within each PSU. Th
e final stage is the selection of patient visits within the annual practices of
 sample physicians. The basic sampling unit for the NAMCS is the physician-pati

*Start from 2005, NAMCS includes provider weight that allow researchers to prod
uce aggregated visit statistics at the physician level. In this analysis, I sum
marized visits level data to physician level data based on recommendation provi
ded by Ambulatory Statistics Branch of Centers for Disease Control and Preventi
on \citep{SasProcedure}. There are 3,777 physicians' information available afte

Chapter 4.

*\section{Estimating treatment effect with observational data}

*Ideally, we would observe physician in three possible conditions: one in which
 she has fully adopted the EHR system, one in which she has partially adopted t
he EHR system, and one in which she has not. We can express our evaluation prob
lem as follows: Let $W_i = 1$ for physician $i$ who has fully adopted the EHR s
ystem, let $W_i = 2$ for physician $i$ who has partially adopted the EHR system
, and let $W_i = 0$ for physician $i$ who has not yet adopted the ENR system. L
et $Y_i(1)$ refer to the time efficiency for physician $i$ who has fully adopte
d the EHR system, let $Y_i(2)$ refer to the time efficiency for physician $i$ w
ho has partially adopted the EHR system, and let $Y_i(0)$ refer to the patient 
interaction time for physician $i$ who has not adopted the EHR system. Although
 all outcomes are possible in theory, we cannot observe all possible outcome $Y
_i(0)$, $Y_i(1)$, and $Y_i(2)$ for physician $i$ while holding all other condit
ions constant. We only observe $Y_i(0)$ if $W_i = 0$, $Y_i(1)$ if $W_i = 1$, an
d $Y_i(2)$ if $W_i = 2$ with our data \citep{imbens2008recent}. People in "trea
tments" and "control" groups likely different in both observed and unobserved w
ays.

*\section{Assumption of causal inference}

*There are two assumptions associate with estimating treatment effect. The firs
t assumption is the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). The SUTVA r
equires that there is no interference between units, that is, treatment assignm
ent of one unit does not affect potential outcomes of another unit. We cannot t
est this statistically with our data. However, we can safely assume that this a
ssumption meets in our analysis since there are no evidence to show the EHR ado
ption at one physician practice has interactions with the outcome in another ph
ysician's practice.

*
[9

]
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*The second assumption is no unmeasured confounders. An estimate of the EHR's e
ffect on doctors' behavior relies on an assumption of no unmeasured confounders
 of treatment assignment, that is,

*\begin{equation*}

*W_i \perp (Y_i(0),Y_i(1),Y_i(2)

*\end{equation*}

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
* \citep{imbens2008recent}. In other words, the assignment of study participant
s to treatment conditions (i.e. fully adopted EHR, partially adopted EHR, and n
o adoption) is independent of the outcome of these three groups. In experimenta
l settings, treatment groups (in this case, physicians who partially or fully a
dopted the EHR system) and control group were random assigned, which ensure tha
t both observed and unobserved factors of treatment and control group have simi
lar distribution. If the assignment to adopt the EHR system is based on randomi
zation, this assumption is easy to statisfy and the causal inference would be s
traightforward. However, this assumption often violates in non-experimental set
ting. This is a strong assumption with the evaluation of EHR effect since a nat
ional level experiment on the effectiveness of the EHR adoption is expensive an
d infeasible. Violation of unconfoundedness could bias result because of omitte
d variable bias.

*To estimate the effect of the EHR adoption on physician behavior, we can obtai
n the following model:

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*\begin{equation*}

*Y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 W_i + \Sigma^k_{i=2} \beta_k X_{ik} + \epsilon_{i}

*\end{equation*}

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*In this model, $Y_{i}$ is the outcome of interest for physician $i$, including
 percentage rate of patient-specific education resource prescribed, time spent 
with the physician, and percentage rate of returned patients. $W_i$ is the EHR 
adoption status for physician $i$, including fully adopted EHR, partially adopt
ed EHR, and no EHR adoption. $X_{ik}$ are $k$ observable characteristics for ph
ysician $i$, including MSA status, physician specialty, Solo status, etc. We wi
ll describe more details in descriptive statistics section. Coefficient $\beta_
1$ estimate the treatment effect of the EHR adoption on three outcome variables
 if the model is correct and satisfies the assumption of unconfoundedness.

*
[10]
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*This condition is unlikely with NAMCS data. For example, physicians in the tre
atment group A, which they fully adopted the EHR systems, may systematically di
fferent than physicians in the control group. This difference could in both obs
erved and unobserved ways. With large number of covariates that has unknown fun
ctional relationship with treatment and outcome, it is hard to specify regressi
on adjustment model. Without appropriate instrumental variable or regression di
scontinuity cutoff available, the propensity score matching method is one of fe
w available techniques that can be used to access the treatment effect of the E
HR system on physician behavior.

*\section{Propensity score estimation}

*As described above, estimating causal effects with observational data is chall
enging since it involves estimating the unobserved potential outcomes. Propensi
ty score methods attempt to replicate two features of randomized experiments. O
n the one hand, propensity score methodologies can create groups that look only
 randomly different from one another (at least on observed variables). On the o
ther hand, propensity score methods do not use outcome variables when setting u
p the design. With these two features, treatment assignment and the observed co
variates are conditionally independent given the propensity score \citep{guo201
4propensity}:

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Conditional on the propensity score, each physician has the same probability o
f assignment to treatment, as in a randomized experiment setting. After propens
ity score estimation, physicians in the control group who have not adopted the 
EHR system are comparable with those who in treatment groups with similar prope
nsity scores, at least on observable characteristics.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Hirano et al. claimed that the resulting estimate is asymptotically efficient 
if the propensity score is estimated non-parametrically using a series estimato
r \citep{hirano2003efficient}. In this analysis, we used Generalized Boosted Ma
chine (GBM) model \citep{mccaffrey2004propensity} to estimate the propensity sc
ore of each physician. GBM is a general, automated, data-adaptive algorithm tha
t fits several models by way of a regression tree, and then merges the predicti
ons produced by each model. It can use all available covariates and is not subj
ect to the particular modeling choices made by the analyst \citep{hillm2015shor
t}. Comparing with traditional models, GBM model offer numerous advantage to so
lve the variable specification problem \citep{guo2009propensity}. Our boosted m
odel uses the default setting of twang package \citep{mccaffrey2013tutorial} wi
th R \citep{rbase}, which has 10,000 GBM interactions, three interactions, a ba
gging fraction of 1.0, and a shrinkage parameter of 0.01, based on McCaffrey's 
(2013) recommendation. We use physician weight as sample weight in multinomial 
propensity score estimation procedure.

*To assess the quality of propensity score estimation, we use diagnostics to ch
eck the balance after propensity score weighting. The goal of propensity score 
estimation and weighting is to have similar covariate distributions in the matc
hed treated, and control groups. We use both numerical summaries of balance and
 graphic summaries of balance to evaluate the quality of propensity score weigh
ting. We relied primarily on the absolute standardized difference (ASD, also re
ferred to as the Effect Size or the absolute standardized mean difference) to a
ssess the balance after weighting.

*\section{Propensity score weighted regression model}

*The essential feature of propensity score weighting model is the treatment of 
estimated propensity scores as sampling weights to perform a weighted outcome a
nalysis. The control of selection biases is achieved through weighting. Counter
factuals are estimated through a regression model \citep{guo2009propensity}.

*When dimension of pre-treatment variables $\textbf{X}$ is large, it is difficu
lt to ensure both the regression model is correct, and a consistent estimator w
ill be obtained \citep{rubin1997estimating}. Also, the estimated modeling leads
 to extrapolation if the distribution of some confounders do not overlap with e
ach other, since the effect is primarily determined by treated subjects in one 
region of $\textbf{X}$ space and by control subjects in another. In contrast, t
he regression model with propensity score weighting largely circumvents this si
nce pretreatment variables $\textbf{X}$ and treatment group variable $W$ should
 be approximately independent after propensity score estimation. By adding cova
riates into the regression adjustment, we will obtain ``double robustness'' tha
t further improve the precision of estimators \citep{lunceford2004stratificatio
n}. We used an estimate of the propensity score as weights, and uses these weig
hts in a weighted regression of the potential outcome on treatment and observed
 covariates.

dependent variables, we use Binomial regression for the EHR adoption status on 
health education prescription rate, Poisson regression for the EHR adoption sta
tus on time spent with MD, and Binomial regression for the EHR adoption status

*Third, we test whether the results are robust to propensity score weighted bin
ary treatment assignment. We create two separated datasets. One with only physi
cians who have fully adopted EHR and control group. Another with only physician

*As shown in Table \ref{tab:desc1}, more physician practice fully adopted the E

e statistically significant relationship with the adoption of the EHR system ($
\chi^2=16.41$). Physicians that are in West region has higher likelihood to ado

eral, practice with higher number of managed tends to have higher adoption rate
 of the EHR system. 38.08\% physician practice with more than ten managed contr
acts has fully adopted the EHR system while only 20.92\% physician practice wit
h no managed contracts fully adopted the EHR system. There are no statistically

*Physician practices with difference EHR adoption status tend to have different
 payment structure. Practice with fully EHR adoption tends to have higher perce
ntage of privately insured patients. On average, 60.85\% visits are privately i
nsured patients at a practice without the EHR system adoption while 64.75\% vis
its are privately insured patients at the practice with the EHR system fully ad
opted. There is slight difference among Medicare, Medicaid, or self-paid patien
ts between different EHR adoption status. Practice with the EHR system fully ad
opted has slightly less likelihood to accept Medicare, Medicaid, or self-paid p
atient, comparing with the control group. Practices with fully adopted EHR syst
em have higher likelihood to accept work compensation patients.

*As for the characteristic of patients, there is no significant age difference 
between the fully treated group and the control group. Practice with the EHR sy
stem partially adopted has higher average patient age. This is constant with pa
tients insurance status since practices with partially adopted EHR system has h
igher likelihood to accept Medicare patients.  There is significant difference 
between the average number of chronological disease between the fully treated g
roup and the control group. Less patient with complex chronological conditions 
visited practice without the EHR system.

*The adoption status of the EHR system has potential influence on outcome varia
bles. Physicians who have fully or partially adopted the EHR system have higher
 likelihood to prescribe patient-specific education resource. While 39.7\% pati
ents have received education resources during their visit at practice without t
he EHR system, more than 44\% patients received education resource during their
 visit at practice with the EHR system adoption. As for patient-physician inter
action time, there is no systematical difference between the practice with the 
EHR adoption or not. On average, patients spend 22 minutes with their medical d
octor, and there is no substantial difference among different EHR adoption stat
us. For returned appointment rate, physician practice who have fully adopted th
e EHR system has lower returned appointment rate (66.16\%), comparing with the 
other groups whose returned appointment rate is higher than 71 percent.
