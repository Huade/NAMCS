*\chapter{Introduction (working)}
Chapter 1.

*The US spend 17.9\% of GDP on health expenditure in 2013, according to the Wor
ld Bank, and it is continuing to growth. Some scholars proposed that one way to
 reduce health care spending and improve health care efficiency is to adopt the
 Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR). The Obama Administration has prioritized t
he improvement of quality and efficiency of the health care system. President O
bama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 which provides f
inancial incentive for adoption and meaningful use of electronic health records
. The adoption of EHR increased rapidly [CITATION NEEDED].

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Given the increasing adoption of EHR, and the implementation of EHR incentive 
programs, the effect of electronic health care record on health outcomes are of
 interest. Empirically measured effect of adopting EHR on cost is still very li
mited, and the results are mixed.

*\section{Background}

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*In 2009, the US Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (AR
RA), which appropriates funds to promote the adoption and use of health informa
tion technology (HIT). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has set aside
 \$2 billion which will go towards programs developed by the National Coordinat
or and Secretary to help health care providers implement HIT and provide techni
cal assistance through various regional centers \citep{hhs_recovery}.

(Please type a command or say `\end')
*The Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services launched the Medicare and Medica
id Electronic Health Care Record (EHR) Incentive Programs after the passage of 
ARRA in 2009. These programs provide incentive payments to eligible professiona
ls, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) as they adopt, imp
lement, upgrade or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. In o
rder to receive the EHR stimulus money, the HITECH act (ARRA) requires eligible
 physicians to show "meaningful use" of an EHR system.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Take the Medicare EHR incentive program as an example. Eligible physicians mus
t attest yearly that they demonstrate meaningful use to receive the EHR incenti
ve and avoid a Medicare payment adjustment. In order to demonstrate meaningful 
use in 2014 Stage 1, eligible professionals must meet 13 required core objectiv
es and 5 menu objectives from a list of 9. The core objectives includes recordi
ng selected patient demographics, maintaining active medication lists, protecti
ng electronic health information, etc. The menu objectives include using certif
ied EHR technology to identify patient-specific education resources, sending pa
tient reminders, and implementing drug formulary checks, etc. \citep{stage1}.

*\section{Effect of EHR on health expenditure}

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Limited empirical studies have estimated the potential net benefits that could
 arise from adopting health information technologies (HITs), including EHR at t
he national level. The RAND Corporation estimated that annual net savings to th
e health care sector from efficiencies alone could be \$77 billion or more base
d on surveys, publications, interviews, and an expert panel review \citep{Rand2
005}. Hillestad et al. claimed that effective EHR implementation and networking
 could eventually save more than \$81 billion annually by improving health care
 efficiency and safety. Savings could be doubled by using health information te
chnology to preventive care and chronic disease management \citep{Hillestad2005
}. However, some other researchers do not find that the adoption of EHR has a p
ositive cost saving effect on national health expenditure. For example, Adler-M
ilstein et al. found that ambulatory EHR adoption did not impact the total cost
, although it slowed ambulatory cost growth \citep{Adler-Milstein2013}. Sidorov
 claimed that much of the literature on EHRs fails to support the primary ratio
nales for using it, and it is unlikely that the U.S. health care bill will decl
ine as a result of EHR alone \citep{Sidorov2006}. There are also researchers th
at suggest the adoption of EHR has a negative effect on cost-reduction  \citep{
Teufel2012}.

*EHR also provides a platform for predictive analysis, saving health care spend
ing by allocating medical resources efficiently. Bates et al. proposed there ar
e unprecedented opportunities to use big data, acquired from EHR, to reduce the
 costs of health care in the United States \citep{Bates2014}. Roski et al. also
 pointed out big data has the potential to create significant value in health c
are by improving outcomes while lowering costs \citep{Roski2014}. However, the 
integration of EHR into predictive analytics is still challenging. Roski et al.
 claimed that big data's success in creating value in the health care sector ma
y require changes in current policies to balance the potential societal benefit
s of big-data approaches and the protection of patients' confidentiality \citep
{Roski2014}.

*\section{Effect of EHR on healthcare efficiency and quality}

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*The effect of EHR on efficiency is mixed. A systematic literature review sugge
sted that 92 percent of the recent articles on health information technology sh
ow measurable benefits emerging from its adoption \citep{Buntin2011}. For examp
le, a study found that hospitals with more advanced health IT had fewer complic
ations, lower mortality, and lower costs than their counterparts \citep{amarasi
ngham2009clinical}. Others suggest that simply adopting electronic health recor
ds is likely to be insufficient to drive substantial gains in quality or effici
ency \citep{DesRoches2010}.

*Time efficiency is one of the possible outcomes of EHR adoption. Physicians sp
end time on patient interactions and the documentation of clinical information.
 Clinicians hope that an EHR could increase patient interaction time, which imp
roves the quality of health care, while reducing documentation time \citep{leun
g2003incentives}. However, EHR is unlikely to reduce documentation time \citep{
poissant2005impact} and the effect of EHR system adoption on time efficiency is
 mixed and varies among different institutions \citep{Chaudhry2006}.

*Another important factor in healthcare efficiency and quality is the likelihoo
d of follow-up health care appointments. Low "kept appointment" rates adversely
 affect continuity of care and lead to inefficient clinic scheduling processes 
\citep{myers2001strategies}. Although the CMS listed ``send reminders to patien
ts per patient preference for preventive/follow-up care'' as an objective in me
asuring the meaningful use of the EHR system \citep{cmsincentive14}, evaluation
s of the effect of EHR on patient follow-up rate are limited.

*Patient-centered education, which is provided by an EHR-based system, allows p
atients to understand their health better and make informed lifestyle adjustmen
ts. CMS requires eligible physicians to provide patient-specific education reso
urces to more than 10 percent of all unique patients in order to obtain the EHR
 incentive program funding \citep{healthit05}. Very limited literature evaluate
d the effect of EHR on the utilisation of patient-specific education resources.

*\subsection{Physicians' financial incentives on EHR}

*On the micro level, EHR has a mixed effect on cost-saving in physician practic
es.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Some scholars claimed that the long-term return on adoption of EHR is positive
. For example, Wang et al. estimated that a provider could gain \$86,400 in net
 benefits from using an electronic medical record for a 5-year period, resultin
g in a positive financial return on investment to the health care organization 
\citep{Wang2003}. Bell and Thornton claimed that, based on the size of a health
 system and the scope of implementation, the benefits of HITs for large hospita
ls can range from \$37M to \$59M over a five-year period in addition to incenti
ve payments \citep{Bell2011}.

*However, more researchers have argued that physicians have an insufficient fin
ancial incentive to implement EHR in the first place. Gans et al. surveyed a na
tionally representative sample of medical group practices and suggested that th
e adoption of EHR is progressing slowly, at least in smaller practices \citep{G
ans2005}. Jha et al. found a similar result, on the basis of responses from 63.
1\% of hospitals surveyed, only 1.5\% of U.S. hospitals have a comprehensive el
ectronic-records system \citep{Jha2009}. Using survey data from 49 community pr
actices, Adler-Milstein et al. found electronic health records will yield reven
ue gains for some practices and losses for many others. Practices encountered g
reater-than-expected barriers to adopting an EHR system \citep{Adler-Milstein20
12}.

[5]
*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Given increased participation in the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health R
ecords (EHR) Incentive Programs, and increased policy interest in controlling h
ealth expenditures, the evaluation of the effect of EHR on physician behavior a
re of interest.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Although the number of health information technology evaluation studies is rap
idly increasing, empirically measured behavior data are limited and inconclusiv
e. Some research projected the potential benefit of the adoption of EHR with da
ta from surveys, publications, interviews, and expert panel reviews. However, t
here is limited research focused on the empirical analysis of nationalwide data
. Literature on the outcomes of adopting EHR, especially the effect of EHR on p
atient-specific health education prescription, is limited. This paper contribut
es to the literature with a national-level perspective, evaluating the outcome 
of EHR adoption on the patient-specific health education prescription, patient 
interaction time, and returned appointment rate.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Another major limitation of the literature is its generalization. Insufficient
 reporting of contextual and implementation factors makes it impossible to dete
rmine why most health IT implementations are successful but some are not. This 
paper will consider which factors may contribute to a better outcome of EHR ado
ption. It could help to make government incentive programs more efficient by se
lecting proper physician practices.

*\chapter{Analysis Plan}
[6]
Chapter 3.

*\section{Data}

*The data source for this study was the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
 (NAMCS) public use micro-data files. NAMCS is a national probability sample su
rvey of visits to office-based physicians conducted by the National Center for 
Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NAMCS has inform
ation at visit level, including whether the physician practice has an Electroni
c Healthcare Record (EHR) system, health education prescription, the breakdown 
of patients by different payment type, time spent with physician for each visit
, and whether the visit is a returned appointment, etc. The sample size for the
 2008, 2009, and 2010 public use micro-data files, which include information ab
out adopting EMR, are 28,741, 32,281, and 31,229 respectively.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*We used information on the adoption of an EMR system to identify the treatment
 groups and potential comparison groups. The survey question was described as "
Does your practice use an electronic medical record or health record (EMR/EHR) 
system? (Not including billing records system)" \citep{NAMCSDOC2010}. Three pos
sible groups in this treatment variable included "Yes, all electronic," "Yes, p
art paper and part electronic," and "No." The other characteristics were used a
s covariates in the propensity score estimation and models.

*The sampling of NAMCS is a multistage process. The first-stage sample included
 112 primary sampling units (PSUs) by geographical distribution. The second sta
ge stratified physicians into 15 groups and selected physicians within each PSU
. The final stage is the selection of patient visits within the annual practice
s of sample physicians. The basic sampling unit for the NAMCS is the physician-
patient encounter or visit.

*Starting from 2005, NAMCS includes the provider weight, which allow researcher
s to produce aggregated visit statistics at the physician level. In this analys
is, we summarized visit level data to physician level data based on recommendat
ion provided by the Ambulatory Statistics Branch of Centers for Disease Control
 and Prevention \citep{SasProcedure}. There were 3,777 physicians' information 
available after the aggregation. 157 cases were dropped afterward due to incomp
leteness and 1 case was ignored due to negative physician weight. 3619 observat
ions were available for further analysis.

*\section{Estimating treatment effect with observational data}

*Ideally, we would observe a physician in three possible conditions: one in whi
ch she has fully adopted the EHR system, one in which she has partially adopted
 the EHR system, and one in which she has not. We can express our evaluation pr
oblem as follows: let $W_i = 1$ for physician $i$ who has fully adopted the EHR
 system, let $W_i = 2$ for physician $i$ who has partially adopted the EHR syst
em, and let $W_i = 0$ for physician $i$ who has not yet adopted the ENR system.
 Let $Y_i(1)$ refer to the time efficiency of physician $i$ who has fully adopt
ed the EHR system, let $Y_i(2)$ refer to the time efficiency of physician $i$ w
ho has partially adopted the EHR system, and let $Y_i(0)$ refer to the patient 
interaction time of physician $i$ who has not adopted the EHR system. Although 
all outcomes are possible in theory, we cannot observe all possible outcomes $Y
_i(0)$, $Y_i(1)$, and $Y_i(2)$ for physician $i$ while holding all other condit
ions constant. We only observe $Y_i(0)$ if $W_i = 0$, $Y_i(1)$ if $W_i = 1$, an
d $Y_i(2)$ if $W_i = 2$ with our data \citep{imbens2008recent}. People in "trea
tment 1", "treatment 2", and "control" groups likely different in both observed
 and unobserved ways.

*\section{Assumption of causal inference}

*There are two assumptions associated with estimating treatment effect. The fir
st assumption is the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). The SUTVA 
requires that there is no interference between units, that is, the treatment as
signment of one unit does not affect the potential outcomes of another unit. We
 cannot test this statistically with our data. This is a strong assumption in o
ur analysis since (1) there is a possibility of communication between different
 physician practices about the adoption of the EHR system, which could possibly
 affect the outcome; (2) there are different versions of the EHR system within 
different practices.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*The second assumption is that there are no unmeasured confounders. An estimate
 of the EHR's effect on doctors' behavior relies on an assumption of no unmeasu
red confounders of treatment assignment, that is, $W_i \perp (Y_i(0),Y_i(1),Y_i
(2)$ \citep{imbens2008recent}. In other words, the assignment of study particip
ants to treatment conditions (i.e. fully adopted EHR, partially adopted EHR, an
d no adoption) is independent of the outcome of these three groups. In experime
ntal settings, treatment groups (in this case, physicians who partially or full
y adopted the EHR system) and control group were randomly assigned, which ensur
ed that both observed and unobserved factors of treatment and control groups ha
ve a similar distribution. If the assignment to adopt the EHR system is based o
n randomization, this assumption is easy to statisfy and the causal inference w
ould be straightforward. However, this assumption is often violated in a in non
-experimental setting. This is also a strong assumption in the evaluation of th
e EHR effect since a national level experiment on the effectiveness of EHR adop
tion is expensive and unfeasible. Violation of unconfoundedness could bias resu
lts because of the omitted variable bias.

*To estimate the effect of EHR adoption on physician behavior, we can obtain th
e following model:

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*\begin{equation*}

*Y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 W_i + \Sigma^k_{i=2} \beta_k X_{ik} + \epsilon_{i}

*\end{equation*}

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*In this model, $Y_{i}$ is the outcome of interest for physician $i$, including
 the percentage rate of patient-specific education resources prescribed, time s
pent with the physician, and the percentage rate of returned patients. $W_i$ is
 the EHR adoption status of physician $i$, including fully adopted EHR ($W_i=1$
), partially adopted EHR ($W_i=2$), and no EHR adoption ($W_i=0$). $X_{ik}$ is 
$k$ observable characteristics for physician $i$, including MSA status, physici
an specialty, solo status, etc. We will the describe more details in descriptiv
e statistics section. Coefficient $\beta_1$ estimates the treatment effect of E
HR adoption on three outcome variables if the model is correct and satisfies th
e assumption of unconfoundedness.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*This condition is unlikely with NAMCS data. For example, physicians in treatme
nt group 1, which have fully adopted the EHR systems, may be systematically dif
ferent than physicians in the control group. This difference could be in both o
bserved and unobserved ways. With large number of covariates that have an unkno
wn functional relationship with treatment and outcome, it is hard to specify re
gression adjustment model. Without an appropriate instrumental variable or regr
ession discontinuity cutoff available, the propensity score matching method is 
one of the few available techniques that can be used to access the treatment ef
fect of the EHR system on physician behavior.

*\section{Propensity score estimation}

*As described above, estimating causal effects with observational data is chall
enging since it involves estimating unobserved potential outcomes. Propensity s
core methods attempt to replicate two features of randomized experiments. On th
e one hand, propensity score methodologies can create groups that look only ran
domly different from one another (at least on observed variables). On the other
 hand, propensity score methods do not use outcome variables when setting up th
e design. With these two features, treatment assignment and observed covariates
 are conditionally independent given the propensity score \citep{guo2014propens
ity}:

*Conditional on the propensity score, each physician has the same probability o
f assignment to treatment, as in a randomized experiment setting. After the pro
pensity score estimation, physicians in the control group who have not adopted 
the EHR system are comparable with those in treatment groups with similar prope
nsity scores, at least on observable characteristics.

*Hirano et al. claimed that the resulting estimate is asymptotically efficient 
if the propensity score is estimated non-parametrically using a series estimato
r \citep{hirano2003efficient}. McCaffrey et al. summarized that recent studies 
of propensity score estimation in a binary case of two treatments show that, in
 terms of bias reduction and mean squared error (MSE), machine learning methods
 outperform simple logistic regression models with iterative variable selection
 \citep{mccaffrey2013tutorial}. One application that uses machine learning algo
rithms to estimate the propensity score is Generalized Boosted Machine models (
GBM).\label{place:gbm}

*GBM is a general, automated, data-adaptive algorithm that fits several models 
by way of a regression tree, and then merges the predictions produced by each m
odel. In other words, GBM estimation captures complex and nonlinear relationshi
ps using nonparametric estimation, which means the complexity of the fitted mod
el depends on sample size. GBM aims to minimize sample prediction error; that i
s, the algorithm stops iterations when the sample prediction error is minimized
 \citep{guo2014propensity}. Compared with traditional methods, ``the GBM model'
s iterative estimation procedure can be tuned to find the propensity score mode
l leading to the best balance between treated and control groups, where balance
 refers to the similarity between different groups on their propensity score we
ighted distributions of pretreatment covariates''  \citep{mccaffrey2013tutorial
}. GBM models can also use all available covariates and are not subject to the 
particular modeling choices made by the analyst \citep{hillm2015short}.

*Two common boost algorithms for propensity score estimation are Stata's \texti
t{boost} program and Rand's \textit{gbm} program. These two different packages 
do not lead to different results on covariate control and estimates of treatmen
t effects \citep{guo2014propensity}. In this analysis, we used the Rand's GBM m
odel \citep{mccaffrey2004propensity} in R \citep{rbase}, to estimate the propen
sity score of each physician. Our boosted model uses the default setting of the
 twang package \citep{mccaffrey2013tutorial}, which has 10,000 GBM interactions
, three interactions, a bagging fraction of 1.0, and a shrinkage parameter of 0
.01, based on McCaffrey's (2013) recommendation. We use physician weight as the
 sample weight in the multinomial propensity score estimation procedure.

*To assess the quality of propensity score estimation, we used diagnostics to c
heck the balance after propensity score weighting. The goal of propensity score
 estimation and weighting is to have similar covariate distributions in the mat
ched treated and control groups. We use both numerical and graphic summaries of
 balance to evaluate the quality of propensity score weighting. We relied prima
rily on the absolute standardized mean difference (ASMD, also referred to as th
e Effect Size or the absolute standardized bias) to assess the balance after we

*\section{Propensity score weighted regression model}

*\label{sec:model}

*The essential feature of a propensity score weighting model is the treatment o
f estimated propensity scores as sampling weights to perform a weighted outcome
 analysis. Propensity score weighting has two advantages. On the one hand, prop
ensity score weighting permits most types of multivariate outcome analysis and 
does not require an outcome variable that is continuous or normally distributed
. On the other hand, unlike matching techniques, the weighting method maintains
 sample size \citep{guo2014propensity}.

*With propensity score weighting, the control of selection biases is achieved t
hrough weighting and counterfactuals are estimated through a regression model. 
When the dimension of pre-treatment variables $\textbf{X}$ is large, it is diff
icult to ensure both the regression model is correct, and a consistent estimato
r will be obtained \citep{rubin1997estimating}. Also, the estimated modeling le
ads to extrapolation if the distribution of some confounders do not overlap wit
h each other, since the effect is primarily determined by treated subjects in o
ne region of the $\textbf{X}$ space and by control subjects in another. In cont
rast, the regression model with propensity score weighting largely circumvents 
this since pretreatment variables $\textbf{X}$ and treatment group variable $W$
 should be approximately independent after propensity score estimation. By addi
ng covariates into the regression adjustment, we will obtain ``double robustnes
s'' that further improves the precision of estimators \citep{lunceford2004strat
ification}. We used an estimate of the propensity score as weights, and used th
ese weights in a weighted regression of the potential outcome on treatment and 
observed covariates.

*Finally, we conducted sensitivity tests for the following four cases.

(Please type a command or say `\end')
*First, we tested the robustness of the result with different covariate control
s in multinomial propensity score weighted regression models. We implemented th
is in two cases: (1) including only treatment variables with no covariates; (2)
 including all possible covariates and the treatment assignment variable.

*Second, we examined whether the results are robust to different multinomial pr
opensity score weighted generalized regression models. Based on the distributio
n of dependent variables, we used Binomial regression for the EHR adoption stat
us on the health education prescription rate, Poisson regression for the EHR ad
option status on time spent with each MD, and Binomial regression for the EHR a
doption status on the returned appointment rate.

*Third, we checked whether the results are robust to propensity score weighted 
binary treatment assignments. We created two separated datasets. One with only 
physicians who have fully adopted EHR and a control group. Another with only ph
ysicians who have partially adopted an EHR system and a control group. We estim
ated the propensity score with binary treatment and estimated the effect of ful
l EHR adoption and partial EHR adoption on outcome variables.

*As shown in Table \ref{tab:desc1}, more physician practices fully adopted the 
EHR system since 2008. While 54.21\% of physicians reported that they had not a
dopted an EHR system in 2008, 5.75\% percentage points fewer physicians reporte
d that they had not adopted an EHR system in 2010, a reduction of 10.6\% compar
ed to 2008. Meanwhile, 38.8\% of physicians reported they had fully adopted an 
EHR system in 2010, while only 27.49\% of physicians reported that they had ful
ly adopted an EHR system in 2008. Compared with 2008 (18.3\%), fewer physicians
 had partially adopted an EHR system in 2010 (12.73\%). The result suggests tha
t the adoption rate of the EHR system is grew rapidly after the implementation 
of the EHR incentive program.

*The adoption of EHR has indicated statistically significant differences betwee
n different practice ownerships ($p<0.0001$). Physicians or physician groups ha
ve a lower likelihood of adopting an EHR system. In our sample, 53.95\% of resp
ondents who are physicians or physician groups reported they have not adopted E
HR. Health Maintenance Organizations (80.51\%) are the most likely to fully ado
pt the EHR system among all health care practice owners. There is no substantia
l difference between different practice ownership types for those who partially
 adopted an EHR system. The full adoption rate among other hospitals (35.26\%),
 other health care corporations (47.59\%), or all others (44.14\%) are also var
iable.

(Please type a command or say `\end')
*There is no statistically significant relationship between the adoption of an 
EHR system and whether the practice is in a metropolitan statistical area ($\ch
i^2=1.4319$). The full adoption rate of MSA areas (32.93\%) and non-MSA areas (
33.08\%) is close to the national average (32.94\%). However, geographic region
s have a statistically significant relationship with the adoption of the EHR sy
stem ($\chi^2=16.41$). Physicians in the West are more likely to adopt an EHR s
ystem, while physicians in the Northeast or South region have less likelihood t
o adopt it, comparing with physicians who are in the Midwest region.

*Another characteristic of physician practices that is of interest is the numbe
r of managed care contracts. The contract between a physician and a managed car
e organization can affect payment, office organization, practices and procedure
s, and confidential records as well as clinical decision-making \citep{mcc2008}
. In general, practices with higher numbers of managed care contracts tend to h
ave higher adoption rates of the EHR system. 38.08\% of physician practices wit
h more than ten managed contracts has fully adopted the EHR system while only 2
0.92\% of physician practices with no managed contracts fully adopted the EHR s
ystem. There are no statistical or substantial differences between partial adop
tion rate with difference managed care contracts.

*Physician specialty has statistically significant relationship with the adopti
on of the EHR system ($p < 0.0001$). Among all physician specialties, general a
nd family practices are the most likely to fully adopt the EHR system. 43.17\% 
of physicians who are in general or family practice reported they had fully ado
pted the EHR system. Ophthalmologists are least likely to adopt the EHR system.
 More than half of ophthalmologists reported they have not adopted the EHR. Amo
ng all other physician specialities, oncology (38.36\%), internal medicine (37.
76\%), urology (37.57\%), and orthopedic surgery (37.09\%) also have a higher l
ikelihood of full EHR adoption.

*Compared with group practice, solo practice is also less likely to fully adopt
 an EHR system. Over half of group practices fully or partially adopted the EHR
 system, while less than 40\% of solo practices adopted the EHR system.

*\section{Continuous variables}

*As shown in Table \ref{tab:desc2}, the adoption status of the EHR system has p
otential influence on outcome variables. Physicians who have fully or partially
 adopted the EHR system are more likely to prescribe patient-specific education
 resources. While 39.7\% of patients have received education resources during t
heir visit at practices without the EHR system, more than 44\% of patients rece
ived education resource during their visit at practices that had adopted EHR. A
s for patient-physician interaction time, there is no systematical difference b
etween practices. On average, patients spend 22 minutes with their medical doct
or, and there is no substantial difference among practices with different EHR a
doption statuses. For returned appointment rate, physician practices that have 
fully adopted the EHR system have a lower returned appointment rate (66.16\%), 
compared with the other groups, whose returned appointment rate is higher than 
71 percent.

*As for the characteristics of patients, there is no significant age difference
 between the fully treated group and the control group. Practices with the EHR 
system partially adopted had a higher than average patient age. This is consist
ent with patients' insurance status, since practices with a partially adopted E
HR system are more likely to accept Medicare patients. There is a significant d
ifference between the average number of chronological diseases between the full
y treated group and the control group. Fewer patients patient with complex chro
nological conditions visited practices without an EHR system.

*
(Please type a command or say `\end')
*Physician practices with different EHR adoption status tend to have different 
payment structures. Practices with full EHR adoption tended to have a higher pe
rcentage of privately insured patients. On average, 60.85\% of visits are priva
tely insured patients at a practice that has not adopted an EHR system while 64
.75\% of visits are privately insured patients at a practice that has fully ado
pted EHR. There is a slight difference in EHR adoption statuses among Medicare,
 Medicaid, or self-paid patients' visits. Practices that have fully adopted the
 EHR system are slightly less likely to accept Medicare, Medicaid, or self-paid
 patients, compared with the control group. Practices that have fully adopted t
he EHR system are more likely to accept work compensation patients.

Chapter 5.

*\section{Measuring propensity score balance}

*The goal of propensity score weighting is to have similar covariate distributi
on (or ``balance'') in the weighted treated and control groups. We relied on th
e absolute standardized mean difference (ASMD, also referred to as the absolute
 standardized bias or the Effect Size) to assess the balance. The ASMD $d_x$ wa
s calculated as the absolute difference in means between two different groups, 
divided by the square root of the average sample variances for this two groups 
using the following formula \citep{haviland2007combining}:

*\subsection{Sufficient iterations of GBM model}

*As discussed in Chapter \ref{place:gbm}, we use the GBM model to balance pretr
eatment variables. To optimize the balance statistics of interest, ASMD, we nee
d to make sure the propensity score estimation models run for a sufficiently la
rge number of iterations. We can assess this optimization process by evaluating
 the relationship between number of iterations and the balance measurement, max
imum ASMD, of weighted data. We can have an optimized-balance weighted data if 
and only if there are sufficient iterations to find global minimum point. In ot
her words, the balance statistic should decrease initially, but should increase
 after reaching the global minimum point before the end of iteration. Figure \r
ef{fig:diag1} shows the relationship between number of iteration and balance me
asurement, maximum ASMD. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:diag1}, it appears that ea
ch of the maximum ASMD is optimized with substantially fewer than 10,000 iterat
ions.

*\subsection{Overlapping assumption satisfied}

*One key assumption of propensity score analysis is the overlapping assumption.
 Propensity score analyses assume that each experiment unit has a non-zero prob
ability of receiving each treatment \citep{mnps2015}. We can examine the plausi
bility of this assumption by evaluating the overlap of the empirical propensity
 score distribution. As shown in the Figure \ref{fig:diag2}, although physician
s who fully adopted EHR have higher possibility to be in this treatment group, 
the overlap assumption generally seems to be met for each treatment group.

*\subsection{Propensity score balance achieved}

*Figure \ref{fig:diag3} and Figure \ref{fig:diag4} graphically summarize balanc
e statistics from propensity score estimation with GBM model. In our analysis, 
each treatment variable of interest has three ASMD statistics, including the di
fference between non-adopter and fully adaptor, the difference between non-adop
ter and partially adopted and the difference between partially adopted and full
y adopted. Figure \ref{fig:diag3} collapses these three statistics to covariate
 level and provides an overall comparison of the ASMD between each groups, befo
re and after weighting. Figure \ref{fig:diag4} assesses the balance before and 
after weighting for each treatment group.The statistically significant differen
ce is indicated by the solid circle.

*As shown in the Figure \ref{fig:diag3}, covariates in unbalanced data is highl
y unbalanced. After weighting, the maximum ASMDs significantly decrease for hig
hly unbalanced variables. Some well-balanced variables have slightly worse bala
nces after weighting because those variables do not predict treatment, led to r
elatively random matching on them. As shown in the figure, the $ASMDs<0.25$ cri
terion is easily met for all pretreatment variables after propensity score weig
hting. Some variates have an ASMD greater than 0.1, which will be included in r
egression analysis later to achieve ``double robustness''.

between each possible pair of treatment in our analysis. Figure \ref{fig:diag4}
 illustrates the difference in maximum ASMDs by each treatment group before and
 after propensity score weighting. Physician practices in different treatment g
roup have heterogeneous characterises before propensity score weighting procedu
re, especially between those who have fully adopted the EHR and those who have 
no EHR adoption (see left panel). Only one variable has not reached ASMD below 
0.1 with statistical difference among all pairwise comparisons (see solid dot i
n weighted data, left panel). Although there are a few variables exceed 0.1 ASM
D threshold in the middle and right penal, non of them are statistically signif
icant. All variables in three treatment groups have less then 0.25 ASMD after p
ropensity score weighting.

*\section{Tabular assessments of balance}

*Table \ref{tab:ess} shows the effective sample size (ESS) before and after pro
pensity score weighting. The ESS is approximately the number of observations fr
om a simple random sample that yields an estimate with sampling variation equal
 to the sampling variation obtained with the weighted comparison observations \
citep{twangvignettes}.  Overall, the effective has reduced to 60.86\% of sample
 without propensity score weighting. While this may seem like a large loss of s
ample size, this indicates that many of the physicians were observably unlike t
heir counterparts in different treatment group and, hence, were not useful for 
isolating the treatment effect of the EHR system.
