\section{Analysis Plan}
Ideally, we would observe physician in three possible conditions: one in which she has fully adopted the EHR system, one in which she has partially adopted the EHR system, and one in which she has not. We can express our evaluation problem as follows: Let $W_i = 1$ for physician $i$ who has fully adopted the EHR system, let $W_i = 2$ for physician $i$ who has partially adopted the EHR system, and let $W_i = 0$ for physician $i$ who has not yet adopted the ENR system. Let $Y_i(1)$ refer to the time efficiency for physician $i$ who has fully adopted the EHR system, let $Y_i(2)$ refer to the time efficiency for physician $i$ who has partially adopted the EHR system, and let $Y_i(0)$ refer to the patient-interaction time for physician $i$ who has not not adopted the EHR system. Although all outcomes are possible in theory, we cannot observe all possible outcome $Y_i(0)$, $Y_i(1)$, and $Y_i(2)$ for physician $i$ while holding all other conditions constant. We only observe $Y_i(0)$ if $W_i = 0$, $Y_i(1)$ if $W_i = 1$, and $Y_i(2)$ if $W_i = 2$ with our data.
